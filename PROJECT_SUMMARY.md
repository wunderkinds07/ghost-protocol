# 1stDibs Dataset Processing Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project successfully processed 1 million URLs from the 1stDibs luxury furniture marketplace to create comprehensive machine learning datasets for various classification and analysis tasks.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. URL Processing & Analysis
- Processed 1,000,000 URLs from 1stDibs
- Achieved 100% parsing success rate
- Processing speed: 26,356 URLs/second
- Extracted rich metadata including categories, materials, periods, and styles

### 2. Dataset Creation
Created 23 different datasets across 7 categories:

#### A. Source Data
- Raw URLs (1M records)

#### B. Metadata & Analysis
- 11 chunked processing reports with pattern analysis

#### C. ML Training Datasets (18 datasets)
- Category classification
- Item type classification
- Era classification
- URL depth prediction
- Text embeddings
- Sequence data
Each with train/validation/test splits (70/10/20)

#### D. Sample Dataset
- 10% mini dataset (101K records) maintaining distributions

#### E. HTML & Parsed Data
- 100 downloaded HTML pages
- Parsed product data with materials, dimensions, periods

#### F. HuggingFace Dataset
- 100 products with 2,917 images
- Multiple format exports (CSV, JSON, TSV)
- Category-specific subsets

#### G. Taxonomy Classification Datasets
- Category classification (2,917 image-label pairs)
- Materials classification (2,917 image-label pairs)
- Style/period classification (2,917 image-label pairs)
- Multi-label classification (2,917 image-label pairs)
- All PII-free (no names, prices, or seller info)

## Technical Achievements
- Implemented chunked processing for memory efficiency
- Created multiple visualization dashboards
- Developed comprehensive data pipeline
- Maintained data quality with validation
- Created both structured and unstructured datasets

## File Organization
```

├── raw/                    # Original URLs
├── reports/               # Analysis reports
├── training/              # ML training datasets

```

## Usage
All datasets are ready for immediate use in machine learning pipelines:

```python
# Example: Load taxonomy classification dataset
import pandas as pd
train_df = pd.read_csv('data/taxonomy_datasets/category_classification/train.csv')

# Example: Load HuggingFace dataset
hf_df = pd.read_csv('data/huggingface_dataset/csv/huggingface_format.csv')
```

## Storage Summary
- Total storage: ~515 MB
- Formats: CSV, JSON, TSV, HTML, Parquet, TXT
- All data locally stored and accessible

## Next Steps
1. Scale HTML downloading to full dataset
2. Implement image caching system
3. Create embeddings for similarity search
4. Build knowledge graph of relationships
5. Train classification models on taxonomy datasets
